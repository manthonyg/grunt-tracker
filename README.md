- Started to rework some small components to better suit the new focus (utilizing the Marine collection)
- Moved search feature away from center of app

### TODO:
- Need to build out the component library a bit more so I have more reusable components to easily move into place to try concepts.
- I want to get all current features working (appointments, accountability, basic information) and then figure out how to utilize that information in the best way possible.

## 11/13 Update

- Created simple bottom nav
- Reworking schema and data structure to better suit user stories

### TODO: 
- Remove uneccesary components that are now staged on one `screen` component
- Add a lot of information to `marines` schema and clean up API. Idea is the majority of the information I will be querying from database will come from this collection rather than `squads`
